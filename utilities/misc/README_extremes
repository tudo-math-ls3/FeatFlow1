{avs,gmv}extremes.f are simple F77-files which read 
 couple of {avs,gmv}-files and determine the minimum 
and maximum values for each physical quantity.

These extremal values are often needed if an automatic 
generation of frames and a corresponding mpeg-movie is 
performed!

After executing {avs,gmv}extremes (in the corresponding
subdirectories {#avs,#gmv}, the user is asked for:

 ISTART,ISTOP,IADD :

Then, the user has to determine the number of the 
first (ISTART) and last (ISTOP) file to be examined, and 
the incremental (IADD). The result is the "local" result 
for each file and the "total" result which contains 
the min/max-values over all files at the end!

These files support only fixed incrementals and have to 
be appropriately modified in the time-adaptive context!!!

Additionally, these files have to be adapted accordingly to 
the number and kind of output quantities!!!
