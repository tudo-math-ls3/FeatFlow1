#  Geometry and Image Viewer Options

BoundingBox on
#  If BoundingBox on is set, then Image Viewer and Geometry Viewer come up
#  with their Bounding Box control already turned on. 

#  NoHW 1 tells the AVS Geometry Viewer to not initialize any hardware
#  renderer. NoHW 1 is used when you are running AVS as a remote X client.
#
# Set this to exclude Hardware (XGL) renderer in geom viewer camera menu
#NoHW                            1

Renderer "Software Renderer"
#  Specifies which renderer will be the default selected in the Geometry
#  Viewer when the first camera window is created.

######################################################################
#  AVS Color Usage Options:

#Colors r g b gray
#  This option controls how many cells of a system colormap AVS will
#  attempt to allocate to itself when it starts.

#  Controls the brightness of the display for all AVS windows except
#  Geometry Viewer output windows produced with a hardware renderer.
#
# Set this for the GT because both X and XGL gamma correction is done by the
# device when the VisualType is TrueColor; without this some modules will be
# corrected twice (e.g. field legend)
Gamma                           1.8

#  This command may be necessary when you are seeing less color
#  rendition than you know your display is capable of.  VisualType lets
#  you specify a visualtype, either PseudoColor, TrueColor, or DirectColor.
#
# Set this for GS and GT to do fast (XGL, gamma corrected on GT) graphics;
# the DefaultVisual is PseudoColor and software renderer would be used
#VisualType                      TrueColor

######################################################################
#  User Interface Window Geometry Options

#  Controls the default X Window System geometry of the display pixmap
#  module's window.
DisplayPixmapWindow             512x512+270+10

#ModulePanelHeight <pixels>
#  Controls the proportion of the Network Construction window devoted to
#  the module Palette as opposed to the Workspace.

#  Specifies the X Window system geometry of the Network Construction
#  Window (Network Editor menu, Module Palette, and Workspace).
#
# Reasonable dimensions for a 1152x900 display (GX and GS)
NetworkWindow                   848x848+250+20
#
# Corresponding dimensions for a 1280x1024 display (GT, GX-plus)
#NetworkWindow                   960x960+290+30

#  Specifies the size of AVS's virtual display in pixels, confining AVS
#  to run within this area.
#
# this value good for olwm with "standard" border & title on 1152x900 display
ScreenSize                      1080x868
#
# this value good for twm with border width of 2 and NoTitle
#ScreenSize                      1120x896
#
# Corresponding dimensions for a 1280x1024 display (GT, GX-plus)
#ScreenSize                      1208x992
#ScreenSize                      1248x1020

######################################################################
#  Layout Editor Options:

#GridSize 10
#  Controls the size in pixels of the Layout Editor's alignment squares
#  when Snap to Grid is switched on.

#ImageAutomagnify off
#  Turning this option "on" will restore the AVS2 behavior of
#  automatically magnifying the image in a Display Image window.

#ImageScrollbars on
#  If set to off, suppresses the adding of scrollbars to display windows that
#  are too small for the image they are currently displaying in Display Image.

#StackSelector radio_buttons
#  Setting StackSelector to choice_browser displays the module names as a
#  scrolling list similar to the file browsers instead of radio_buttons.

WindowMgr olwm
#  This option ensures that the Network Editor's Layout Editor and the X
#  Window System window manager that you are using work correctly together.
#  Recognized values are:  awm, mwm, twm, uwm, olwm(Open Look), dxwm(Dec XUI).

#XWarpPtr off
#  Causes the mouse cursor to be automatically moved ("warped") into
#  typein panels when they appear when this is turned on.

#  Pathname and file options:

DataDirectory /home/people/featflow/data
#  Specifies the directory in which the various AVS data input file
#  browsers used in the subsystems and modules initially look for data files.

#HelpPath $Path/runtime/help
#  Expands the list of directories that AVS will search to find a
#  module's documentation when you click Show Module Documentation.

#Hosts $Path/runtime/hosts
#  Gives the name of a "Hosts" file that lists machines, access
#  methods, and directories of remote modules.

#  Specifies which libraries of modules will be loaded into the Network
#  Editor's module palette.
ModuleLibraries                 
                                $Path/avs_library/UCD \

NetworkDirectory /home/people/featflow/featflow/graphic/avs/appl/nets
#  Specifies the directory in which the AVS Network Editor initially will
#  look for network files (Read Network and Write Network functions).

#Path /usr/avs
#  Specifies the directory tree in which AVS itself is installed.

Applications  /home/people/featflow/featflow/graphic/avs/appl/featflow.applns
#  Sets the file that AVS uses to build the large Applications menu.

#  Peripheral Device interfaces:

#  Specifies devicefilespec as the serial communications port to which
#  a dialbox device is attached.
#DialDevice                      /dev/dialbox

#  Indicates the serial communications port to which a Spaceball device
#  is attached.
#SpaceballDevice /dev/ttya

######################################################################
#  Basic operating parameters:

#DirectModuleCommunication 1
#  Turns direct module-to-module communication on or off.

NetWriteAllParams on
#  AVS saves only parameters that have been modified out to a network file.
#  Setting this option to on, will enable saving all parameters, 

#PrintNetwork lpr 
#  The Network Editor's Print Network button normally sends output to
#  your default printer.  This lets you specify an alternate print command.

#ReadOnlySharedMemory 1
#  Shared memory is normally "read only."  ReadOnlySharedMemory 0 allows
#  shared memory to be written into.

#SaveMessageLog off
#  If set to the value on, causes the AVS message log to be preserved
#  when the AVS session ends normally.

#SharedMemory on
#  Specifying SharedMemory off turns off AVS's shared memory feature.
